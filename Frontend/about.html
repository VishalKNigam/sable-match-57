          <h1>About Sephora</h1>
          <p>
            A leader in prestige omni-retail, our mission at Sephora is to
            create a welcoming beauty shopping experience for all and inspire
            fearlessness in our community.
          </p>

          <p>
            We operate over 2,700 stores in 35 countries worldwide, with an
            expanding base of over 500 stores across the Americas, and a
            world-class ecommerce site. Since opening our first US store in New
            York’s SoHo neighborhood in 1998, Sephora has been an
            industry-leading champion of diversity, inclusivity, and empowerment
            in the US, guided by our longstanding company values.
          </p>

          <p>
            Owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading
            luxury goods group, Sephora was founded in France by Dominique
            Mandonnaud in 1970 and is defined by its unique, open-sell
            environment with an ever-increasing assortment of products from
            carefully curated brands, featuring emerging favorites, trusted
            classics, and Sephora’s own line, Sephora Collection. Sephora
            continues to curate innovative brands including a robust Clean
            beauty assortment and exclusive brands like Rare Beauty by Selena
            Gomez and FENTY BEAUTY by Rihanna brought to market first by
            Sephora. Today, Sephora is a powerful beauty presence in countries
            around the world thanks to our unparalleled assortment of prestige
            products in every category, unbiased service from beauty experts,
            interactive shopping environment, and relentless innovation,
            including our expanding array of the ways in which clients can shop
            with Sephora.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sephora has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s Best
            Employers four years in a row, from 2018-2021. For three years in a
            row, from 2019-2021, Sephora scored 100% on the Human Rights
            Campaign’s Corporate Quality Index, the national benchmarking tool
            on corporate policies and practices pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees.
          </p>

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
          <p>
            At Sephora, our diversity and inclusion mission is simple: To never
            stop championing all beauty fearlessly and building inclusive
            environments for our employees, consumers, and communities. In 2019,
            Sephora announced a new tagline and manifesto, “We Belong to
            Something Beautiful,” to reinforce our dedication to fostering
            belonging among all clients and employees and to publicly strive for
            a more inclusive vision for retail in the Americas. In 2020 Sephora
            launched our Diversity and Inclusion Heart Journey to support our
            vision of becoming the Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Champion in
            the retail industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, we’re committed to creating a culture of belonging. In
            2020 Sephora became the first major retailer to take the 15 Percent
            Pledge, committing 15% of our assortment to prestige Black-owned
            companies. By the end of 2021, we’ll more than double our assortment
            overall, including achieving the 15% benchmark in prestige haircare.
          </p>

          <p>
            To continue our commitment to bringing diversity, equity, and
            inclusion to the core of our mission, Sephora has dedicated our
            annual Sephora Accelerate program to brands with founders of color.
            To learn more about our Accelerate program, please visit

          <h3>The Racial Bias in Retail Study Commissioned by Sephora</h3>
          <p>
            This first-of-its-kind national study was conducted over a yearlong
            period, beginning in the fall of 2019 and ending in late 2020, and
            was designed to measure the issue of racially biased experiences in
            US retail and to identify opportunities to end unfair treatment.
            Comprising academic literature reviews, cultural insights analysis,
            and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative research, the Racial
            Bias in Retail Study commissioned by Sephora offers an in-depth look
            at this important issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the research is to call attention to the inequities of
            retail shopping experiences for consumers and, more importantly,
            identify actionable solutions to galvanize change. The research
            identified five primary “truths” that define retail shoppers’
            experiences with racial bias along with offering ways in which other
            retailers can leverage the learnings. Coupled with the study’s
            findings and our all-encompassing Diversity and Inclusion Heart
            Journey strategy, Sephora designed a preliminary action plan to
            tackle bias across all aspects of the organization via three key
            areas: Marketing and Merchandising; The In-Store Experience and
            Operations; and Talent and Inclusive Workplaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sephora has committed to bi-annual share outs of our progress
            towards creating an inclusive environment for all. To learn more
            about the study, as well as the latest updates of our action plan
            and Diversity and Inclusion Heart Journey, please visit
            <a href="#">www.sephora.com/diversity-and-inclusion</a> and our
            <a href="#">Sephora Newsroom.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Best-in-Class Omnichannel Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Sephora.com launched in the US in 1999 and quickly became Sephora’s
            largest North American store, where clients can today discover and
            interact with more than 340 curated brands and more than 45,000
            products and engage with the Beauty Insider Community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obsessed with teaching and inspiring clients to play in a world of
            beauty, Sephora has pioneered the use of mobile in beauty, creating
            groundbreaking content on our intuitive Sephora app and on social
            media to bring Sephora’s expertise to our clients whenever and
            wherever they want. Please follow along at YouTube, Instagram,
            Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a leader in digital innovation, Sephora continues to provide the
            best-in-class e-commerce experiences and meet our clients where they
            are. The dynamic shifts in consumer behavior, accelerated by the
            COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in a variety of strategic digital
            partnerships to increase the ways our clients can shop, prioritizing
            ease and convenience, including Facebook Live Shopping, Same Day
            Delivery, Buy Online Pick Up In Store and Instagram Checkout to name
            a few.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the latest evolution of the industry-leading Color iQ, Sephora
            has relaunched this complexion matching tool with AI technology.
            Current shade matching in the industry only accounts for depth and
            undertone, while Sephora's new Color iQ technology also includes a
            third and critical component, saturation. The Sephora-proprietary AI
            technology includes the use of an unbiased algorithm that provides
            clients with a proprietary dataset of 10K+ skin tones, suitable
            across all shade ranges, ensuring a personalized match for all.
          </p>
          <h3>Beauty Insider Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            In 2007 Sephora launched a client loyalty program to offer clients
            exclusive benefits and rewards. The Beauty Insider program is
            available in Sephora stores nationwide and at sephora.com. In 2009
            Sephora launched VIB (Very Important Beauty Insider), and in 2013
            added Rouge. Since the program’s continued evolution in 2020, Beauty
            Insiders can now redeem cash rewards and have even more samples to
            choose from and exclusive access to events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beauty Insider Community—Sephora’s own Beauty Insider Community is
            one of the world’s largest beauty forums, with more than three
            million members. The members-only mobile and online platform is a
            first for the prestige retail industry and serves as a destination
            for beauty lovers to find inspiration, ask questions, and get
            recommendations in an unsponsored, real-time, “real talk” social
            setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sephora Credit Card – In 2019 Sephora introduced the Sephora Credit
            Card, Sephora Visa® Credit Card, and Sephora Visa Signature® Credit
            Card, giving Sephora clients even more ways to get rewarded for
            shopping their favorite brands. Sephora cardholders earn credit card
            rewards in addition to rewards in the retailer’s existing Beauty
            Insider Program. Sephora Visa Signature cardholders also have access
            to further Visa Signature benefits.
          </p>
          <h3>Distribution Centers</h3>
          <p>
            Sephora has five distribution centers located across four
            states—Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, and Utah—totaling more than
            1,600 employees moving products throughout the country to our stores
            and clients’ doorsteps.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our continued commitment to create an inclusive space for our
            employees, Sephora’s distribution centers are leading the way by
            creating accessible environments that welcome talent with
            disabilities. A structured nine-week training program, a commitment
            to equal pay for equal work, and equitable performance standards are
            some of the ways we respect the dignity of our employees with
            disabilities and value talent in all its forms. Our employees can
            expect state-of-the-art facilities that help simplify and streamline
            our processes to expand employment opportunities for our diverse
            workforce. To learn more, please visit

          </p>
          <h3>Sephora at Kohl’s</h3>
          <p>
            The new long-term strategic partnership between one of the largest
            omnichannel retailers and the leading global specialty beauty
            retailer offers a fully immersive, premium beauty destination,
            prominently located at the front of Kohl’s store. In August 2021,
            Sephora at Kohl’s officially opened the doors to its first location
            in Ramsey, NJ and exclusively launched its beauty selection on
            Kohls.com, with around 125 of Sephora’s most beloved brands. 200
            locations have opened in the fall of 2021, and shoppers can expect
            at least 850 locations by 2023.
